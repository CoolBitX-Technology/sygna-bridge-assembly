# Cryptocurrency
It contains all the information related to cryptocurrencies/tokens compliant or compatible with Sygna Bridge support.
## Format/filename:
The cryptocurrency/tokens are described in individual, JSON-formatted files. The filename for each cryptocurrency/token file should follow the Sygna-formatted currency_id with a `.json` extension.
# The assembled lists
This repository has the cryptocurrencies/tokens as single files. This makes it easier for contributors to add or update new cryptocurrencies /tokens, for reviewers to get a good view on the change, and also makes it easier to merge in cryptocurrencies /tokens from other sources. Projects will most likely want to use the assembled lists. The CI server is already building them - so you can file a Pull Request (PR) with a number of well-defined clearly described commits.

# Note
If you find an error or omission, please open an issue or make a PR with any corrections.
